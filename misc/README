The header files in this directory are used for the testbenches in `tb`. Those 
tests may rely on the environment being set up using the files in here. This 
entails the register file being set up with these test headers, and the xilinx 
IPs being generated as per the `xips_user.tcl` script.

# HEADERS

The `.svh` files are example header files for configuring the axi-lite driven 
`axi_lite_reg_file_*` register file modules. The original form of these headers 
is in the mcm_rtl_lib misc directory, alongside with how to use them. They are 
here because the testbench for the axi_lite_reg_file_* cores relies on the 
register file being parameterized as given by these headers.
Keep in mind that in an m_code_manager-generated project, the headers still need 
to be made accessible to the simulation tool, for example by copying them to the 
project's 'include' directory (this directory is not regarded as any sort of 
source directory by the tool flow).

# XILINX IPS

A block RAM IP is described, which acts as an AXI protocol checker for the 
`axi4_master`. The testbench hooks it up to the BRAM's AXI interface, and tests 
are done by a series of write and read backs. You need to integrate the IP 
described there in the projects `xips` directory, add them to the vivado project 
using the respective make targets, and from there the output products are 
generated, exported and integrated into compilation for mcm-supported 
simulators.
